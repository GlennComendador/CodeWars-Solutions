# OtherPrograms
This Repository contains programs I answered as challenges in codewars website. You may view the codes under the **src Folder**.

CodeWars is a website that allows you to challenge and answer programming questions, and allows you to rank up if correct.
Visit www.codewars.com to know more.


Currently, this Repository contains 5 Programs:

**1. PIG LATIN**
    The Program allows user to enter a phrase and converts it into Pig Latin.
    The Structure of the word is the First Character of a Word, will be moved to the
    Last Part of the Word. The letters "AY" will be added at the end, next to the First
    Character. Non Letters and Numbers will retain their spot.

    EX: HELLO WORLD !
    PL: ELLOHAY ORLDWAY !
    
**2. VOWEL CHECKER**
    The program finds the number of vowel letters in a given word/s.
    
**3. MISSING LETTER FINDER**
    The program finds the missing letter in a given section of the alphabet
    inputted to the function. Program distinguishes UPPERCASE from lowercase.
    
**4. DUPLICATE CHECKER**
    The program checks the number of letters that has a duplicate.
    
**5.  ODD OR EVEN FINDER**
    Finds the Number that is an ODD or an EVEN Number in an Array of Numbers.
    
**6. HUMAN READABLE TIME**
    Enter a number (seconds), and the program will output it in HH:MM:SS.
    
**7. CAMELCASE BREAKER**
    The program finds the Uppercase Letter in a camelCase String. If found, it
    will separate and output the separated word/s with an Uppercase Letter. If
    no Uppercase Letter was found, it will output the word without modifications.
    
    
    
More code will be added as I take on the challenges in codewars.com.

Thank you!
